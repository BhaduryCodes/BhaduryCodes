# 👋 Hi, I’m Ahmad — I Turn Code into Memes & Memes into Code 🎨🤖

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m a **meme creator disguised as a developer** — or maybe it’s the other way around.  
Either way, I write code that makes people **laugh**, **think**, and occasionally **cry from secondhand embarrassment**.

## 😎 What I Do

- 🖼️ Build meme-generating tools from scratch
- 🤖 Use AI to suggest hilarious captions
- 🎨 Design intuitive drag-and-drop meme editors
- 💻 Mix code, culture, and chaos
- 🧠 Sprinkle GPT-powered genius on top of every template

> _If it can be memed, it shall be._
